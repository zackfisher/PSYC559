## Installing R Packages

One of the main reasons to be excited about R is the package library system. In R, packages are like apps. R packages extend the functionality of base R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded freely without much hassle (compared to many other package libraries). For example, we will often use the `ggplot2` package for plotting and visualizing data and the `psych` package for describing data numerically.

To install R packages you can use the `install.packages()` function directly in the console as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

or you can do so from the Packages tab of the Files pane in RStudio using the following steps:

1.  Click on the “Packages” tab.

2.  Click on “Install” next to Update.

3.  Type the name of the package under “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):” In this case, type `ggplot2`.

4.  Click “Install.”

## Using R Packages

Once a package is installed you can load it into your environment using the `library()` function. Once loaded you have access to all the R functions supplied by that package.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```

## Finding Useful R Packages

There are many ways to find useful R packages on the internet simply by googling the type of data or analysis you are interested in. Another way is to look at the [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). For example, there is an interesting [Task View for Machine Learning](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html) that contains many relevant packages you might be interested in using. Some class members expressed interest in F1 racing. In the S[ports Analytics Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SportsAnalytics.html) there is a [`f1dataR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/f1dataR/index.html) package that provides historical data from the beginning of Formula 1.
