This `.qmd` file contains all of the relevant information for our first week of the Network Analysis seminar.

To start off the quarter, we will review the syllabus including things such as the topics we will cover, the final project for the course, and sign-ups for weekly presentations.

The general layout of each weekly meeting is as follows:

1.  A topical overview of the readings for the current week and a discussion of the methods
    1.  These may include comments or questions resulting from the readings
2.  A coding session where parts of the weekly readings are transformed into actionable code to illustrate their use and interpretability
