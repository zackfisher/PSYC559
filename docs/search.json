    "text": "One of the main reasons to be excited about R is the package library system. In R, packages are like apps. R packages extend the functionality of base R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded freely without much hassle (compared to many other package libraries). For example, we will often use the ggplot2 package for plotting and visualizing data and the psych package for describing data numerically.\nTo install R packages you can use the install.packages() function directly in the console as follows:\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nor you can do so from the Packages tab of the Files pane in RStudio using the following steps:\nOnce a package is installed you can load it into your environment using the library() function. Once loaded you have access to all the R functions supplied by that package.\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nThere are many ways to find useful R packages on the internet simply by googling the type of data or analysis you are interested in. Another way is to look at the CRAN Task Views. For example, there is an interesting Task View for Machine Learning that contains many relevant packages you might be interested in using. Some class members expressed interest in F1 racing. In the Sports Analytics Task View there is a f1dataR package that provides historical data from the beginning of Formula 1.",

    "text": "Prediction errors can be broken down into two main parts: bias and variance.\nThese represent different sources of mistakes a model can make.\nUsually, there’s a tradeoff between keeping bias low and keeping variance low. It can be exceptionally hard to minimize both at the same time.\nBy understanding where bias and variance come from, we can make better choices when building models and end up with more accurate predictions.\nLet’s approach each concept in turn.\nBias is the difference between the average prediction from our model and the true value which we are trying to predict.\nIn machine learning, bias often refers to the systematic error in a model.\nBias in ML can lead to incorrect or unfair outcomes, possibly from flawed or incomplete training data, or perhaps from poor assumptions made by the algorithm.\nA biased model fails to accurately reflect the true relationship in the data, leading to poor generalization and skewed predictions.\nIn statistics, variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.\nIn machine learning, variance typically refers to the sensitivity of a model’s predictions to small changes in the training data.\nSo, error due to variance is defined as the variability of a model prediction for a given data point.\nBias and variance are often introduced together in the context of the bias-variance tradeoff that occurs when models overfit, or underfit the data.\nWhen a model overfits the data, it means the model has learned too much from the training data, including random noise or minor fluctuations, rather than just the true underlying patterns.\nWhen a model underfits the data, it means the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.",

    "text": "Feature engineering in ML typically describes the process of creating, transforming, or selecting variables (features) from raw data to improve a model’s performance. This often means transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that better capture the underlying patterns the model needs to learn.\nFor example, suppose we are trying to predict medicine adherence (whether or not someone takes their medicine). Our raw data might be timestamps of when someone actually takes their medicine. We may use that timestamps to create variables for day of the week, holiday or weekend to provide additional context to the model.\nDomains considered to be part of a feature engineering pipeline can include:\nTo introducing feature engineering we will explore some example data from the GSS.\nIn this example we will use data from the General Social Survey. The General Social Survey (GSS) is a long-running, nationally representative survey of adults in the United States that has been conducted almost every two years since 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. The GSS data is often used to measure American’s attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs on a wide range of topics—such as politics, religion, crime, race relations, family, work, and technology.\nThere are two ways to access the GSS data. One is using the GSS Data Explorer. Another option is using the gssr (Healy 2023) R package. Here we will use the gssr (Healy 2023) package to download some example data.\nWe will start by choosing happy as our target variable. This comes from Question 157 of the 2024 GSS where respondents were asked:\nResponses were coded such that 1 indicates “very happy”, 2 indicates “pretty happy”, and 3 indicates “not too happy”, while NA indicates “don’t know.”\nWe can also identify ad bunch of features we think predict self-reported happiness and save our final dataset.\nlibrary(gssr)\n\nPackage loaded. To attach the GSS data, type data(gss_all) at the console.\nFor the panel data and documentation, type e.g. data(gss_panel08_long) and data(gss_panel_doc).\nFor help on a specific GSS variable, type ?varname at the console.\n\ngss24 &lt;- gss_get_yr(2024)\n\nFetching: https://gss.norc.org/documents/stata/2024_stata.zip\n\ntarget &lt;- \"happy\"\n\nfeatures &lt;- c(\n  \"age\",     # age of participant\n  \"sex\",     # sex of participant\n  \"race\",    # race of participant\n  \"educ\",    # highest education completed by participant\n  \"income\",  # income of participant\n  \"childs\",  # number of children participant has\n  \"wrkstat\", # work force status\n  \"marital\", # marital status\n  \"born\",    # whether or not participant was born in USA\n  \"partyid\"  # political party of participant\n)\n\ndata &lt;- gss24[,c(target, features)]\n\ntable(data$happy, useNA = \"always\")\n\n\n   1    2    3 &lt;NA&gt; \n 684 1892  705   28\nDealing with missing data in a consistent manner is one of the most important aspects of feature engineering.\nMuch attention is paid to the mechisms producing missing data in the statistics and applied sciences literature.\nKnowing how the missing data came about is critical for knowing how to handle it in a subsequent analysis.\nAlthough attention to missing data mechanisms has historically not been a primary focus in the ML literature, this has been changing.\nA common framework for understanding missing data mechanisms was described by Rubin (1976). Here we will briefly describe these mechanisms in the context of our current data example.\nIn MCAR, the probability of a value being missing is unrelated to the value itself or any other observed or unobserved variable. This is a purely random and unsystematic process.\nImagine a cat opening up your dataset in Excel and walking across the keyboard, randomly deleting different cells.\nDefinition: Missingness in self-reported happiness, for example, is unrelated to the respondent’s true happiness level or any other variables.\nExample: Let’s say there is a glitch in the online GSS survey and for some respondent’s questions are randomly skipped. This means the probability of missingness is purely random, and it does not depend on other variables (e.g. income, age, or happiness levels).\nImplication: Dropping these cases (listwise deletion) or using simple imputation will not bias the results, although efficiency is reduced.\nIn MAR, the probability of a value being missing is systematically related to other observed variables in the dataset, but not to the unobserved value itself.\nDefinition: Missingness in happiness depends on other observed variables but not directly on happiness itself.\nExample: Suppose in the GSS, individuals with higher incomes were less likely to answer the happiness question. Missingness on happiness is explained by income, which is observed. Conditional on income (having income in our model as a predictor), the probability of missingness does not depend how happy one is.\nImplication: Methods like multiple imputation (MICE), missForest, or regression-based imputation can use income (and other observed covariates like marital status, education) to predict and impute missing happiness values without bias.\nDefinition: Missingness in happiness depends on the unobserved happiness score itself.\nExample: Respondents who are very unhappy may avoid answering the happiness question because it feels too personal, while those who are extremely happy may skip it because they consider it obvious. Missingness is directly tied to the unreported happiness level.\nImplication: Standard imputation methods will be biased. Handling MNAR requires explicitly modeling the missingness mechanism (e.g., selection models, pattern-mixture models)\nOften a first step in handling missing data involves recoding missing values as NA. Writing bespoke code to handle the different types of missing data one might encounter is tedious and unnecessary.\nnaniar (Tierney and Cook 2023) is a useful package with many convenience functions for managing missing data in R. Here we demonstrate some of this functionality.\nNow that we have a dataset with missing values we can use naniar to recode these values to NA.\nlibrary(naniar)\n\nna_strings &lt;- c(\"NA\", \"N/A\", -99)\n  \ndata &lt;- naniar::replace_with_na_all(\n  data, condition = ~.x %in% na_strings\n)\nSee the naniar vignette on recoding NA values for more detailed information on the package functionality.\nOnce we have recoded our data in a consistent manner we can use visualizations to explore the missing data. The vis_miss() function from naniar is a good starting point for visualizing the amount of missing data in our dataset. The plots shows the missing values in black and non-missing values in gray. In addition, percentages of missing data in both the dataset and individual variables are provided.\nnaniar::vis_miss(data)\nIt is often useful to look at combinations of missingness among different variables.\nnaniar::gg_miss_upset(data)\nWe can also look at the percentage of missing data across a factor variable.\nnaniar::gg_miss_fct(x = data, fct = marital)\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_tile()`).\nMany missing data visualizations are described in the naniar vignette on missing data visualization including plots for exploring missing data mechanisms.\nBelow is a small dataset looking at predictors of happiness. Some values are missing.\nIn small groups please speculate on why each value might be missing and which type of missing data mechanism it represents: MCAR, MAR, or MNAR.\n# Columns: id, happiness (target), age (feature), income (feature), education (feature)\n# NA indicates missing values\n\nexample_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = 1:15,\n  happiness = c(NA, 8, 5, NA, 6, 9, 4, 7, NA, 5, 6, 8, 7, NA, 4),\n  age = c(25, NA, 30, 40, 22, 35, NA, 29, 31, 28, 34, NA, 27, 33, 26),\n  income = c(50000, 55000, 6500, 70000, NA, NA, NA, 62000, NA, 45000, 52000, NA, 58000, NA,61000),\n  education = c(\"Bachelor\",\"Bachelor\",\"Master\",\"Master\",\"HighSchool\",\"Bachelor\",\"HighSchool\",\"Master\",\"Bachelor\",\"HighSchool\",\"Master\",\"Master\",\"Bachelor\",\"HighSchool\",\"Bachelor\")\n)\n\nexample_data\n\n   id happiness age income  education\n1   1        NA  25  50000   Bachelor\n2   2         8  NA  55000   Bachelor\n3   3         5  30   6500     Master\n4   4        NA  40  70000     Master\n5   5         6  22     NA HighSchool\n6   6         9  35     NA   Bachelor\n7   7         4  NA     NA HighSchool\n8   8         7  29  62000     Master\n9   9        NA  31     NA   Bachelor\n10 10         5  28  45000 HighSchool\n11 11         6  34  52000     Master\n12 12         8  NA     NA     Master\n13 13         7  27  58000   Bachelor\n14 14        NA  33     NA HighSchool\n15 15         4  26  61000   Bachelor\nThere are a number of ways to handle missing data. Below I will discuss some of the most common ways of addressing missing data.\nListwise deletion (also called complete-case analysis) is one of the simplest methods for handling missing data in a dataset.\nWhen performing listwise deletion we remove any row that has one or more missing values across any variable used in the analysis.\nAfter deletion, only rows that are complete for all variables remain.\nFor example, our example GSS data has 3,309 rows before we address the missing data. If we only kept rows that contained no missing data we would have 2,780 observations. You can perform listwise deletion on your data using the complete.cases() function as demonstrated below. Then you can visualize the missing data to ensure there is no missingness on the new dataset.\n# nrow(data) # 3,3309 rows\n\ndata_cc &lt;- data[complete.cases(data),]\nnrow(data_cc)\n\n[1] 2780\n\nnaniar::vis_miss(data_cc)\nNow, listwise deletion should really only be used if data is missing completely at random (MCAR). In this case it can still provide unbiased results, although they can be less efficient (reduced power and more uncertainty).\nImputation is the process of filling in missing values in a dataset with estimated or predicted values so that you can perform analyses without dropping incomplete cases.\nUnlike listwise deletion, imputation retains all observations, reducing data loss. Imputation can be simple (deterministic, like a mean) or more involved (stochastic, model-based).\nEstimated Statistic\nA simple approach to imputing missing values for a feature is to compute descriptive statistics such as the mean, median, or mode (for categorical) and use that value to replace the NA values.\nAlthough computationally efficient, this approach does not consider any other attributes for a given observation when imputing.\nThe tidymodels (Kuhn and Wickham 2020) R package has a number of useful functions for machine learning. Here we use the package to perform mean imputation on our dataset.\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.4.1 ──\n\n\n✔ broom        1.0.9     ✔ recipes      1.3.1\n✔ dials        1.4.2     ✔ rsample      1.3.1\n✔ dplyr        1.1.4     ✔ tailor       0.1.0\n✔ ggplot2      3.5.2     ✔ tidyr        1.3.1\n✔ infer        1.0.9     ✔ tune         2.0.0\n✔ modeldata    1.5.1     ✔ workflows    1.3.0\n✔ parsnip      1.3.3     ✔ workflowsets 1.1.1\n✔ purrr        1.1.0     ✔ yardstick    1.3.2\n\n\n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ purrr::discard() masks scales::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()  masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()     masks stats::lag()\n✖ recipes::step()  masks stats::step()\n\n# create a recipe\nrec &lt;- recipe(happy ~ ., data = data) %&gt;%\n  step_impute_mean(all_predictors())   \n  # apply mean imputation to predictors\n\n# prep the recipe (estimates imputation values)\nrec_prep &lt;- prep(rec)\n\n# check the imputed values\ndata_mi &lt;- bake(rec_prep, new_data = NULL)\n\nnaniar::vis_miss(data_mi)\nK-Nearest Neighbor\nAnother popular method for performing imputation is k-nearest neighbor.\nNow, instead of just filling in a missing value with a simple number like the mean, KNN looks for other respondents who are most similar (the “nearest neighbors”) and uses their information to fill in the blank.\nHow KNN Imputation Works\nBetter than Mean Imputation?\nThink of guessing someone’s favorite pizza topping:\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n# create a recipe\nrec &lt;- recipe(happy ~ ., data = data) %&gt;%\n  step_impute_knn(all_predictors())   \n  # apply mean imputation to predictors\n\n# prep the recipe (estimates imputation values)\nrec_prep &lt;- prep(rec)\n\n# check the imputed values\ndata_knn &lt;- bake(rec_prep, new_data = NULL)\n\nnaniar::vis_miss(data_knn)\nTree-Based Imputation\nTree-based imputation methods use decision trees (or random forests) to predict missing values based on the other variables in the dataset. Similar to KNN methods, tree-based methods make a tailored prediction using patterns in the data.\nTree-based methods are especially nice for imputation as they handle non-linearities and interactions, and can accomodate mixed data types, like continuous and categorical variables.\nHow Tree-Based Imputation Works\nBetter than Mean Imputation?\nThink of tree-based imputation like asking:\nThis is smarter than saying “everyone makes the same average income” (mean imputation) or even “let’s just look at your 3 closest neighbors” (KNN).\nFeature filtering is a feature selection technique in machine learning where features are evaluated individually (typically prior to the model fitting) using statistical or heuristic criteria, and then kept or discarded based on those criteria.\nIt is called filtering because the method acts as a preprocessing step, part of a feature engineering pipeline, before actually training the model.\nTypically, the goals of feature filtering are:",
