---

Welcome to the Machine Learning seminar!

Throughout this course, we will be covering fundamental topics in graph theory and network analysis and how these concepts may relate to modeling and understanding psychological phenomenon.

It will be your responsibility to stay up-to-date with topics and voice any concerns or confusion [by e-mailing me](mailto:imJPark@UCDavis.edu).

Please regularly check this page as well as the syllabus [on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/) for updates to the schedule or topics. If you require assistance or accommodations, please reach out to the [Student Disability Center (SDC)](https://sdc.ucdavis.edu/) to file for them and they will reach out to me. You are welcome to disclose to me as well in the interim; however, official documentation is still necessary.

In the tabs to the left, you will find each topic arranged by weeks.

Notice, this page is dedicated to students enrolled in both the PSC-190 **and** PSC-290 forms of Network Analysis. This is intentional. Many of the topics we discuss will be in parallel. Only the content and style of the materials will change between sessions.
