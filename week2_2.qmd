# Major Classes of Machine Learning Problems
:::

Machine learning applications correspond to a wide variety of learning problems. Some major classes include:

## Classification

-   The *goal of classification* is often toassign a category or label to each observation.
-   The music genre problem is a good example of a classification problem
-   **Note:** The number of categories can be small, large, or even unbounded (e.g., optical character recognition, text classification, speech recognition).

*Can you think of any examples of algorithms you encounter in your everyday life that solve classification problems?*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Regression

-   In regression problems we are typically concerned with predicting a real-valued number for each item.

-   For example, we might be interested in predicting stock prices, or how .\
    stressed out someone is.

-   **Notes:** The penalty for prediction errors depends on the magnitude of the difference between true and predicted values, unlike classification where categories are discrete and there is often no notion of distance between various categories.

## Ranking

-   With ranking problems we are often tasked with ordering items according to a specific criterion.
-   A well-known example of a ranking algorithm is Google's [PageRank](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs54n/handouts/24-GooglePageRankAlgorithm.pdf) algorithm.
-   **Notes:** Ranking problems focus on relative order rather than exact category or numeric value.

*Can you think of any examples of algorithms you encounter in your everyday life that solve ranking problems?*

## Clustering

-   In clustering problems we are typically looking topartition items into similar groups or regions.
-   For example, in social network analysis we are interested in identifying communities within large groups of people
-   **Notes:** Clustering is often applied to very large datasets to reveal underlying structure.

*Can you think of any examples of algorithms you encounter in your everyday life that solve clustering problems?*

## Dimensionality Reduction

-   When looking to solve dimension reduction problems we are typically interested in transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving important properties.
-   Common examples in psychology include identifying constructs in survey data or scales.
-   **Notes:** Dimension reduction is also useful for feature extraction, noise reduction, and speeding up downstream learning tasks.

*Can you think of any examples of algorithms you encounter in your everyday life that solve dimension reduction problems?*

# Binary Classification and You
:::

We will now complete a short in-class exercise demonstrating how one might build a binary classifier to solve a classic classification problem.
