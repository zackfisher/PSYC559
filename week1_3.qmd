## Numerical Summaries of Data Frames
:::

Once you have read in a data frame it can be useful to know how the variables are understood by R. For example, let's look at some [Kaggle Marketing Analytics Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data){.uri}. You can download the raw data [here](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test).

### Read in Marketing Data

Let's read in the data using the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
setwd("/Users/zacharyfisher/Dropbox/Macbook/UNC/Teaching/Courses/PSYC559/PSYC559-Site/data")
df <- read.csv("ifood_df.csv")
```

### Install and Load `psych` Package

Once we know the data has been read into R we can look at how R understands the data file using the structure function `str()`

```{r}
str(df)
```

The `psych` package in R provides some useful function for describing data. Let's install `psyc`, load the package, and look at our data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("psych") # install the package
```

```{r}
library("psych") # load the library
```

### Describe the Data

Now let's use the `describe()` function from `psych` to look at our marketing data.

```{r}
describe(df) # describe our marketing data
```

### Describe the Data by Group

We may also be interested in describing the data based on a specific grouping factor. For example, let's look at our summaries based on whether or not a customer has lodged a formal complaint.

```{r}
describeBy(df, group = "Complain") # describe our marketing data
```
